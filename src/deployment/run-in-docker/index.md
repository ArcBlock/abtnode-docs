![docker pull](https://img.shields.io/docker/pulls/arcblock/abtnode.svg)

You can use Blocklet Server with docker:

## 1. Pull Image

```shell
docker pull arcblock/abtnode
```

## 2. Run

```shell
docker run -d -p 80:80 -p 443:443  -v <your host directory>:/data/abtnode arcblock/abtnode
```

The data generated by the node is placed in the /data/abtnode directory in the container, and we recommend trying not to place the data in the container, keep the container stateless.

We also provide Docker images in the Github Container Registry and AWS ECR, so you can choose the appropriate Registry for your scenario, [details.](../../developer/docker-registry)
