Blocklet Server is responsible for executing all components like Service gateway, Blocklets, etc. Additionally, Blocklet management allows you to control the lifecycle of each Blocklet. You can install, start, stop, reload, upgrade and remove each blocklet. All these events are handles by Blocklet Server and thus logged under the corresponding logs.
