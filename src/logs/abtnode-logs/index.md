ABT Node is responsible for executing all components like Service gateway, Blocklets, etc. Additionally, Blocklet management allows you to control the lifecycle of each Blocklet. You can install, start, stop, reload, upgrade and remove each Blocket. All these events are handles by ABT Node and thus logged under the corresponding logs.

```bash
