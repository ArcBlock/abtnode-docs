## Upgrade and downgrade Blocklets

As you work with Blocklets you will on occassion need to upgrade/downgrade your Blocklets. By default, Blocklets do not auto-upgrade to ensure that compatibility is maintained for your software. 

In this scenario, we will show you how to easily upgrade or downgrade a blocklet through the marketplace.  ABT Node makes it easy to recognize when an upgrade is available by coloring coding the buttons depending on the status of the button - green (currently installed), blue (available ot install), and black (upgrade or downgrade available).

1) Let's go ahead and start by visiting the ABT Node marketplace and view your installed blocklets.

2) In this example, we can see that several blocklets are installed on the ABT Node and for this example we are going to upgrade our **Blockchain Explorer Blocklet**. Next to the installed version, select the drop down and pick the latest version. You will now see the following asking us to upgrade.

3. You can simply click on the button to upgrade. Or, you can review all the current Blocklet versions before confirming you upgrade.

4. You can see multiple versions are available to be installed and depending on your software you can either pick the latest version, or the version that is compatible with your software. Let's go ahead and select the top one from the list again and click on **"upgrade."** Upon upgrading, the node will notify you that the blocklet was upgraded.

5. Downgrading a blocklet follows a similar process.  Simply select the dropdown menu and select a previous version. Upon doing so, you will see the option to downgrade.
