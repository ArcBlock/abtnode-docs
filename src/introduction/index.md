## ABT Node Key Concepts

To help you quickly get started wtih ABT Node, it's important to understand that ArcBlock's ABT Node is the foundation of the platform and gives developers an end-to-end platform that enables them to easily create, deploy, and manage decentralized applications and blockchains easily. Some of the key features and concepts to be aware of include: 

- Blocklets

Blocklets are the key building blocks for ABT Node that include stand-alone apps, reusable components and developer tools, or smart contracts that can be installed from the Blocklet Marketplace

- Modern Blockchain Framework

To help you build modern blockchain software, ABT Node includes all the batteries including

- One-click deployments

One-click deploy blockchain networks and run and scale your blockchain networks including a built-in atomic swap protocol for interchain communications and exchanges

- Open Chain Access Protocol

An open protocol that lets you access underlying blockchains and ensure your blockchain software can work with different supported blockchains

- Networking

Integrated service gateway to manage and customize your routing rules, SSL certificates, load balancing and communications, and more. 

- Integrated Decentralized Identity Support

W3C DID compatible Decentralized Identity tools, libraries, and reusable components for creating and using digital W3C compliant identities rooted on ArcBlocks blockchains
