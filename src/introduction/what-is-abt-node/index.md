## What is ABT Node?

ArcBlock's ABT Node is a next generation developer platform designed to help you create, deploy and manage modern blockchain apps. With the new ABT Node, every developer has an end-to-end development system that includes an integrated Blockchain Framework, decentralized Identity, and run time that helps you build and run your apps.

With ABT Node, you can easily setup and install your own blockchains, integrate decentralized identity for apps built on ArcBlock or to support external apps, or build new apps using ready-made Blocklets.

#### Blocklets: Building Blocks for Decentralized Apps

ABT Node gives you access to Blocklets the key building blocks to create and run decentralized applications. 

* Blocklets can be designed to be stand alone applications, reusable components, or a smart-contract that when added can extend the features of your blockchain(s).

* ABT Node's built-in framework uses a combination of serverless computing and a microservices architecture to reduce the effort, time and complexity of running scalable and modern blockchain applications in the cloud.  

* A Blocklet Marketplace with ready-made Blocklets that let you extend the capabilities of your ABT Node by giving you **one-click** deploy components, developer tools, and services for your projects.  

#### Modern Blockchain Framework

To build modern blockchain software you need a framework that includes all the batteries so you can focus on your business.  ABT Node includes: 

* One-click blockchain deployments using the available Blockchain Manager Blocklet with options to easily run and scale your blockchain networks.

* Interconnected blockchains using ABT Nodes built-in cross chain atomic swap protocol to make inter-chain communication and assets exchange easy. 

* Open Chain Access Protocol to enable developers to access underlying blockchains and ensure your blockchain software can work with different supported back-end services including blockchains and databases. 

#### Built-in Decentralized Identity Support

Ready-made W3C DID compatible Decentralized Identity services including developer ready tools, libraries, and reusable components for creating and using digital identities rooted on ArcBlock's blockchains and are interoperable across all ArcBlock created networks, applications, and services.
