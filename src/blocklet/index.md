## What is a Blocklet?

Before we look at the basic operations of Blocklets, let's review look at what a Blocklet is. ArcBlock created Blocklets to remove the commplexity out of building DApps and to give developers building blocklets to help them quickly create and deploy their software projects. Blocklets can be stand-alone apps, reusable components and developer tools, or smart contracts that can all be installed from the Blocklet Marketplace.

## Key Features 

Blocklets give you a better way to create and deploy DApps. Blocklets give developers a consistent, uniform way to create and deploy DApps and services across their projects and environments. With Blocklets developers can quickly use one, or connect them together to create new services for their projects. Each Blocklet includes several key features: 

- Standardized packaging and tooling 

- Free and Paid Blocklets

- Serverless, Microservices Architecture

- Automatic upgrades and easy rollbacks

- Integrated Decentralized Identity

- Integrated Service Routing 

- Configuration management
